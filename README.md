# My submission for the CSC2515 final project (back in 2003)
In this [paper](https://github.com/vglazer/csc2515_final_project/blob/master/MLProjectReport.pdf) 
we compare the generalization performance of two 
[ensemble methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_learning): 
[boosting](https://www.face-rec.org/algorithms/Boosting-Ensemble/decision-theoretic_generalization.pdf) 
and ["arcing"](http://web.cs.iastate.edu/~honavar/boost4.pdf). A MATLAB
[implementation](https://github.com/vglazer/csc2515_final_project/tree/master/src) 
is provided.
